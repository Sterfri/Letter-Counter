# Letter-Counter
This was a project to help me learn how to use one of pythons most popular Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), tkinter. The purpose of this program is to help teachers or residents assistants, like myself, figure out how many letters they need to cut out for there board. This was a fun project to work on but im sure there are other uses for this program.
